                <h2>Misile Man of India</h2>
                <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (listen); 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was
                    an Indian aerospace
                    scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
                    raised in
                    Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades
                    as a scientist and
                    science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian
                    Space Research
                    Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military
                    missile development
                    efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of
                    ballistic missile
                    and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and
                    political role in
                    India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in
                    1974.[5]</p>
